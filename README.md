# Smart-Diet-Planner
Smart dietitian application is a web page that provides a generic diet to its users.
It acts as a diet consultant similar to a real Dietitian. 
This system acts in a similar way as that of a dietitian.
A person in order to know his/her diet plan needs to 
give some information to the dietitian such as its body type, weight,
height and working hour details.
A similar way this system also provides the diet plan according to the information entered by the user.
The system asks for all his data from the user and processes it to provide the diet plan to the user. Thus, the user does not need to visit any dietitian which also saves time and the user can get the required diet plan in just a click. 
The system will give more accurate results as it accepts the data entered by the user and processes it depending on some metrics already known to the application on the basis of which a diet plan is generated and asks the user if the user accepts the diet plan.
The Application also has a card for preparing healthy food at home and also provides all the general knowledge and some amazing facts on our foods. 
This Application can be a vital part of a user if he wishes to maintain his health and body perfectly and follow the diet plan & the workout plan provided to the user.
